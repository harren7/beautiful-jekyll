subtitle: Welcome to my personal website!

I am a second-year master's student at Brown Univeristy studying Data Science. 

I am deeply interested in providing useful detection programs that can provide early diagnosis of mental disorders. I am also interested in making effective decision-making algorithms for individuals and corporates. I am currently studying Natural Language Processing(NLP) and speaker diarization to connect my interest in language with computer science.

I lived in Vietnam when I was young and now I am currently living in Seoul, South Korea. In my free time, I love watching Netflix and Youtube videos to learn about other cultures and languages. 

I find joy in inspiring people to pursue their goals and helping people to understand about themselves better. I have a [blog](https://harren.tistory.com/) where I post articles about programming languages :)
