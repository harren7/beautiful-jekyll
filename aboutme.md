subtitle: Welcome to my personal website!

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Hanyang Univeristy studying Electronic Engineering. 

I am deeply interested in providing useful detection programs that can provide early diagnosis of mental disorders. I also aim to make effective decision-making algorithms for individuals and corporates to make better choices and strategies. I also want to expand my field of interest in Natural Language Processing.

I lived in Vietnam when I was young and now I am currently living in Seoul, South Korea. In my free time, I love watching Netflix and Youtube videos to learn new languages. 

I find joy in inspiring people to pursue the goals they want to achieve and helping them understand better about themselves. I own a [blog](https://harren.tistory.com/) where I post articles about programming languages and another popular [blog](https://blog.naver.com/rndbwjd97) where I post how awesome it is to pursue a STEM major!
