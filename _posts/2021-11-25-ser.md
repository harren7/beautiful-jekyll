## Motivation
Many people with autism struggle to classify peopleâ€™s emotions, so they learn how to distinguish emotions according to facial and vocal expressions. 
Considering that some autistic people find it hard to make eye contact, I wanted to make an emotion recognition program using speech.

## Presentation 
I presented the project in a competition hosted by the Ministry of Science and ICT and supervised by the National Research Foundation of Korea, South Korea and won the Ministry of Science and ICT Minister Award and People's choice Award

This is a demo post to show you how to write blog posts with markdown.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](https://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
